## Introduction

The **Inclusify** Flutter app is designed to assist hearing-impaired individuals during emergency situations by providing real-time transcription of spoken words and alert notifications. This app continuously listens to its surroundings, transcribes spoken words into text, highlights and vibrates for emergency announcements, and even activates the flashlight in case the user cannot feel the vibration. Additionally, it allows users to add emergency contacts who will receive SMS notifications when an emergency announcement is detected.

## Features

- Real-time speech-to-text transcription of surrounding conversations.
- Highlighting and vibrating alerts for emergency announcements.
- Flashlight activation for notification in case of no contact.
- Adding and managing emergency contacts.
- Automatic SMS notifications to emergency contacts during emergencies.
